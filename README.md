# PATTERN-PRINTING
## AIM: To write a program that prints a pattern of equilateral triangle filled with '*'.
## ALGORITHM: 
1) Start.
2) declare variable r.
3) Get the number of rows up to which the triangle is reuired to be constructed and store it in r.
4) In each row, a blank should be printed at 'r-i' positions and then '*' for (2i-1) times(where i starts from 1 and the increments upto required conditions).
5) Stop

## Description:
This program uses nothing but 'for' loops and logic of positions of elements in a 2-D array.
